        <p class="SH">Abstract</p>
	<p> We present a new computational technique which
enables the probabilistic analysis of cDNA microarray data and we
demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying features of
biomedical importance. A hierarchical Bayesian model, called
Latent Process Decomposition (LPD), is introduced in which each
sample in the dataset is represented as a combinatorial mixture
over a finite set of latent processes, which are expected to 
correspond to biological processes. Parameters in the model are
estimated using efficient variational methods. This type of
probabilistic model is most appropriate for the interpretation of
measurement data generated by cDNA microarray technology. For
determining informative substructure in such datasets the proposed
model has several important advantages over the standard use of
dendrograms. Firstly, the ability to objectively
assess the optimal number of sample clusters. Secondly, the
ability to represent samples and gene expression levels using a
common set of latent variables (dendrograms cluster samples and
gene expression values separately which amounts to two distinct
reduced space representations).  Thirdly, in constrast to standard
cluster models, observations are not assigned to a single cluster
and thus, for example, gene expression levels are modeled via combinations of
the latent processes identified by the algorithm. We show this new
method compares favourably with alternative cluster analysis
methods. To illustrate its potential we apply the proposed
technique to several microarray datasets for cancer. For these
datasets it successfully decomposes the data into known subtypes
and indicates possible further taxonomic subdivision in addition
to highlighting, in a wholly unsupervised manner, the importance
of certain genes which are known to be medically significant. To
illustrate its wider applicability we also illustrate its
performance on a microarray dataset for yeast.</p>

of the gene-specific variational parameter for each process (top

second, sixth and eighth process profiles is required for this

processes identified by LPD.</i><p>
